This condition is associated with disturbed sleep, which has a direct impact on patient quality of life. Patient-reported outcomes are frequently used to assess sleep quality, but show modest correlations with objective measures of sleep, such as polysomnography. Working towards our goal of an automated ambulatory system of assessing sleep quality, we use features from blood volume pulse (BVP) and electrodermal activity (EDA) collected with a wearable device during sleep. We compare these measurements between individuals with fibromyalgia who experienced poor sleep and individuals in a control group who experienced refreshing sleep. By applying Learning Using Concave and Convex Kernels (LUCCK) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), we achieve mean Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.6573 and 0.6526, respectively, by using BVP data for classifying individuals to the two groups.","tags":["fibromyalgia","signal processing","wearable"],"title":"Predicting Poor Sleep Quality in Fibromyalgia with Wrist Sensors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Olivia Alge**","Yingqi Hua","Jonathan Gryak","Kayvan Najarian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543795200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543795200,"objectID":"b3c39f72ce234d0618e3ae72c37aab50","permalink":"https://olialge.github.io/publication/bibm2018/","publishdate":"2018-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bibm2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Meta-analysis of gene expression provides the opportunity to compare gene expression across different platforms.

To determine the relative positions of type I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C (PLC) in this pathway, we analyzed macropinocytosis in macrophages stimulated by the growth factor macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and by the diacylglycerol (DAG) analog phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In cells stimulated with M-CSF, microscopic imaging of fluorescent probes for intracellular lipids indicated that the PI3K product phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) appeared in cups just prior to DAG. We then tested the hypothesis that PMA and DAG function after PI3K and prior to Ras and protein kinase C (PKC) during macropinosome formation in macrophages. Although the PI3K target Akt was activated by M-CSF, the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 did not inhibit macropinocytosis. The phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 blocked macropinocytosis by M-CSF but not PMA. Macropinocytosis in response to M-CSF and PMA was inhibited by the Ras inhibitor farnesyl thiosalicylate (FTS), by the PKC inhibitor Calphostin C and by the broad specificity inhibitor rottlerin. These studies support a model in which M-CSF stimulates PI3K in macropinocytic cups, and the resulting increase in PIP3 activates PLC, which in turn generates DAG necessary for activation of PKC, Ras and the late stages of macropinosome closure.","tags":["maropinocytosis","signaling","microbiology/immunology"],"title":"Differential signaling during macropinocytosis in response to M-CSF and PMA in macrophages","type":"publication"}]
