Moreover, the information needed to compute the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) defined by Sepsis-3 may not be immediately available for patients that require care. Continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) recording is often available for patients in intensive care, and may be useful to identify those at risk of decompensating to septic shock. Additionally, structuring multi-lead ECG data as a higher-order tensor can preserve the dataâ€™s structure and prevent loss of information that can occur in traditional machine learning, which structures data as 1-dimensional vectors. The project discussed here is a first step in this research: the development of a tensorial data classification method, and its testing with publicly available ECG data. Methods: We developed a tensor classification method based on multilinear discriminant analysis via Kempf-Ness Theory (KNMDA). We compare performance of this method to existing tensor methods and traditional machine learning, including support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA), at different noise levels. We constructed 3rd order tensors using 12-lead ECG data from the Physionet PTB database, which contains samples of both normal control and unhealthy subjects. Results: Over thirty iterations, our KNMDA method obtained average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.94 (SD 0.03), an improvement compared to linear SVM with 0.91 (0.03) and LDA with 0.68 (0.07) with no additional noise. When signal-to-noise ratio of the ECG signal was changed to -10, KNMDA achieved average AUC of 0.92 (0.03), compared to SVM with 0.85 (0.06) and LDA with 0.59 (0.07).Impact: The results show that our proposed method can outperform existing ones when using real ECG data. We can therefore apply this method to our larger goal of improving risk-stratification for septic patients, to augment physician decision-making and improve patient care.","tags":[],"title":"Application of a Tensor-Based Classification Method with Electrocardiogram Data","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Olivia Alge**","Lu Lu","Zhi Li","Yingqi Hua","Jonathan Gryak","Kayvan Najarian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1595203200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595203200,"objectID":"762f3971a8035c50fdb06121eccab73b","permalink":"https://olialge.github.io/publication/embsost/","publishdate":"2020-07-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/embsost/","section":"publication","summary":"Osteosarcoma is a prominent bone cancer that typically affects adolescents or people in late adulthood.

This condition is associated with disturbed sleep, which has a direct impact on patient quality of life. Patient-reported outcomes are frequently used to assess sleep quality, but show modest correlations with objective measures of sleep, such as polysomnography. Working towards our goal of an automated ambulatory system of assessing sleep quality, we use features from blood volume pulse (BVP) and electrodermal activity (EDA) collected with a wearable device during sleep. We compare these measurements between individuals with fibromyalgia who experienced poor sleep and individuals in a control group who experienced refreshing sleep. By applying Learning Using Concave and Convex Kernels (LUCCK) and Support Vector Machines (SVM), we achieve mean Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.6573 and 0.6526, respectively, by using BVP data for classifying individuals to the two groups.","tags":["fibromyalgia","signal processing","wearable"],"title":"Predicting Poor Sleep Quality in Fibromyalgia with Wrist Sensors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Olivia Alge","Lu Lu","Zhi Li","Yingqui Hua","Jonathan Gryak","Kayvan Najarian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573750800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573750800,"objectID":"c03f52fc82e20985b0fb1093a6d20882","permalink":"https://olialge.github.io/talk/midas2019/","publishdate":"2019-11-14T12:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/midas2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Background: Osteosarcoma contributes to roughly 20% of bone cancers, typically afflicting children and adolescents. While chemotherapy and tumor resection can treat the disease, a timely diagnosis is necessary to prevent metastasis from forming. Imaging techniques such as x-ray and MRI can locate tumors and metastases, and when coupled with a biopsy, can diagnose a tumor as benign or osteosarcoma. The exact cause of osteosarcoma is unknown, but previous studies have identified genes that are regulated differently in osteosarcoma as compared to normal tissue. Methods: In this project, we classify bone tumors as osteosarcoma or benign using imaging features and RNA-seq data. Each observation contains imaging features from x-ray images of the tumor and read counts from RNA-seq data. The RNA-seq read counts for each observation are first filtered based on specified selection criteria: either transcripts of genes that have been identified in literature as being up- or down-regulated in osteosarcoma, or those that are marked as differentially expressed. Second, principal component analysis is performed on all features as a feature reduction step. Lastly, selected principal components are used as features to train a random forest model, which creates the final prediction on the test data. Results: In leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), using imaging features with RNA-seq data and using literature-identified genes results in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.86 or greater when using at least two principal components to train the random forest. Using 3-fold cross-validation results in an AUC of 1.0 when using two or more principal components. Using imaging features with RNA-seq data from differential expression analysis, an AUC is 1.0 is achieved using one or more principal components in both LOOCV and 3-fold cross-validation. Impact: Genetic information coupled with imaging features can aid in classifying osteosarcoma versus benign tumors.","tags":["osteosarcoma"],"title":"Classification of Osteosarcoma or Benign Tumor using RNA-seq and Imaging Data","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Olivia Alge**","Yingqi Hua","Jonathan Gryak","Kayvan Najarian"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1543795200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543795200,"objectID":"b3c39f72ce234d0618e3ae72c37aab50","permalink":"https://olialge.github.io/publication/bibm2018/","publishdate":"2018-12-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bibm2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Meta-analysis of gene expression provides the opportunity to compare gene expression across different platforms.

To determine the relative positions of type I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase C (PLC) in this pathway, we analyzed macropinocytosis in macrophages stimulated by the growth factor macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and by the diacylglycerol (DAG) analog phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). In cells stimulated with M-CSF, microscopic imaging of fluorescent probes for intracellular lipids indicated that the PI3K product phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate (PIP3) appeared in cups just prior to DAG. We then tested the hypothesis that PMA and DAG function after PI3K and prior to Ras and protein kinase C (PKC) during macropinosome formation in macrophages. Although the PI3K target Akt was activated by M-CSF, the Akt inhibitor MK-2206 did not inhibit macropinocytosis. The phospholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 blocked macropinocytosis by M-CSF but not PMA. Macropinocytosis in response to M-CSF and PMA was inhibited by the Ras inhibitor farnesyl thiosalicylate (FTS), by the PKC inhibitor Calphostin C and by the broad specificity inhibitor rottlerin. These studies support a model in which M-CSF stimulates PI3K in macropinocytic cups, and the resulting increase in PIP3 activates PLC, which in turn generates DAG necessary for activation of PKC, Ras and the late stages of macropinosome closure.","tags":["maropinocytosis","signaling","microbiology/immunology"],"title":"Differential signaling during macropinocytosis in response to M-CSF and PMA in macrophages","type":"publication"}]
